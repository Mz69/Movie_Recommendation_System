# Movie_Recommendation_System
Project Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset in R. The system leverages collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user preferences. The project includes various stages such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and performance evaluation. Additionally, the recommendation model has been integrated into an interactive Shiny web application, providing an intuitive interface for users to get personalized movie suggestions.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and structures the MovieLens dataset, ensuring that data is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies trends and patterns in user ratings, such as the most popular movies, rating distributions, and user preferences.
Collaborative Filtering: Builds a collaborative filtering model that recommends movies based on similarities between users' ratings.
Performance Evaluation: Measures the model’s performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to fine-tune the recommendation accuracy.
Shiny Web App: The recommendation model is integrated into a Shiny app, allowing users to interact with the system and receive personalized movie suggestions.
Technologies Used

R: For data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
Shiny: For creating an interactive web application.
tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.
recommenderlab: For building the collaborative filtering recommendation model.
RMSE: For evaluating model accuracy.
MovieLens Dataset: A widely used dataset containing movie ratings and metadata, which serves as the basis for the recommendation system.
Project Workflow

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The project begins by loading the MovieLens dataset (ratings.csv and movies.csv) into R.
The data is cleaned and processed, ensuring that all missing or irrelevant values are handled.
The data is then transformed into a realRatingMatrix, which is the format required for collaborative filtering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Key insights are gathered by performing EDA, such as finding the distribution of ratings, identifying popular movies, and exploring user behavior.
Visualizations are used to present findings and better understand patterns in the data.
Collaborative Filtering:
The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering, specifically user-based filtering, to generate movie recommendations based on similarities in user ratings.
The recommenderlab package is used to build the model, which identifies similar users and predicts movies they may like based on what others have rated highly.
Performance Evaluation:
The model's accuracy is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), which is calculated by comparing the predicted ratings with actual ratings.
Fine-tuning is done to improve recommendation quality by adjusting model parameters.
Shiny Web Application:
The recommendation model is integrated into a Shiny web app, which provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
Users can input their movie preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations based on the collaborative filtering model.

Future Enhancements

Hybrid Filtering: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based filtering to improve the recommendation system’s performance.
Deep Learning Models: Implement deep learning techniques, such as neural collaborative filtering, to further enhance recommendations.
User Interface Improvements: Enhance the web interface with more features, such as displaying movie posters or ratings from other users.
Real-Time Recommendations: Add real-time feedback loops, where users can rate movies, and the system updates recommendations instantly.
Conclusion

This Movie Recommendation System is a simple yet effective implementation of collaborative filtering using R and the MovieLens dataset. By using a data-driven approach, it provides personalized movie recommendations and serves as a foundation for building more complex recommendation systems. The integration of the model into a Shiny web app makes it accessible for users to interact with and get movie suggestions in real time.
